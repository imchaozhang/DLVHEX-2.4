% testNonmon implements the following mapping
% from the extension of the predicate input to the output tuple:
% {} -> {2},  {1} -> {1},  {2} -> {1},  {1,2} -> {1,2}
%
% There are two model candidates: {1}, {1,2}
% Both are compatible but only {1} is subset-minimal
%
% dlvhex2 currently outputs both models if the
% minimality check is disabled (--nomincheck, works only with genuine solvers).
% This is (probably) due to the wrong implementation of the FLP check.
% If the FLP check would be correct, {1,2} should be eliminated
% (even without explicit minimality check) because it is
% not a subset-minimal model of fP^{1,2}.
% However, as {1,2} spuriously passes the FLP check,
% an explicit minimality check is needed to guarantee correct
% behavior.
%
% Note: I am not completely sure if this is actually a bug in the FLP check,
% but I strongly believe it.
