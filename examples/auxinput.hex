% This program demonstrates a bug in the construction of the EA guessing rules in dlvhex 2.1.0.
% It requires the use of the G&C mg for the whole program because of the default negation.
% All external atoms are inner and therefore need to be guessed.
% The guessing rule created for &testConcat[Y, ""](Z) in the first rule is:
%   aux_r(Y, "", Z) v aux_n(Y, "", Z) :- dom(Z).
% But then Y is not safe.
% The problem can be fixed by adding the auxiliary input aux_i_0(Y) to the rule body of the guessing rule.
e(Z) :- d(X), &testConcat[X, ""](Y), &testConcat[Y, ""](Z), dom(Y), dom(Z).
d(Y) :- e(X), &testConcat[X, ""](Y), not &testConcat[X, ""](Y), dom(Y).
