% This example demonstrates that also the second implementation of the FLP check was not entirely correct.
% &testNonmon2[p](a) implements the following mapping: {} -> {2}, {1} -> {2}, {2} -> {}, {1,2} -> {1,2}.
% Here, the guessing program has the single model {p(1),p(2)}.
% The reduct f P^{p(1),p(2)} = P has no smaller compatible set than {p(1),p(2)}.
% However, it has the smaller model {p(2)} (which is no compatible set because it is not founded).
% As answer sets are defined as subset-minimal models (and not compatible sets) of the reduct,
% {p(2)} invalidates {p(1),p(2)} as an answer set.
