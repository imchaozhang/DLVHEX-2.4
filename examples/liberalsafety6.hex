% If evaluated with --heuristics=monolithic and --domainexpansionsafety,
% this program tests if it works that outer external atoms become inner ones.
% While forbidden with strong safety, this should work with domainexpansionsafety.

% If evaluated with --heuristics=monolithic, parameter q in &id[q](Z) is unstratified,
% thus the domain exploration algorithm needs to guess the assignments to q(a).
% With --heuristics=greedy the second rule is in a different component and
% both can be solved with plain model generator.
