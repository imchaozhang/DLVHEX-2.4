% This example demonstrates that the old implementation of the FLP check is wrong.
% &id[p](a) evaluates to true iff p(a) is true.
% Here, the guessing program has one model: {p(a)} (which is also subset-minimal as it is the only one)
% The reduct f P^{p(a)} = { p(a) :- &id[p](a). } has a smaller model {}.
% As the old implementation checks only if a candidate is a model of the reduct,
% but not if it is a subset-minimal model, the FLP check is wrongly passed.

p(a) :- &id[p](a).
:- not p(a).
