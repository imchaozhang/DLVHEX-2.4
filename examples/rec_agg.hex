% This program has two compatible sets:
% {p(2), q(a), p(1)}
% {p(2)}
% Only the second is subset-minimal, i.e., {q(a), p(1)} is an unfounded set wrt. the first compatible set.
% This is currently only detected with --aggregate-mode=ext, because --aggregate-mode=simplify is only currect for stratified aggregates.
p(3) :- not p(2).
p(2) :- not p(3).
q(a) :- #sum{ X : p(X) } == 3.
p(1) :- &id[q](a).
