% This example demonstrates that there is a problem
% with the minimality check in the translation approach
% (GuessAndCheckModelGenerator).
%
% The program yields two answer sets: {dom(a), p(a)} and {dom(a)},
% but only the latter one is subset-minimal.
%
% The genuine solvers (--solver=genuinegc) work correctly.
% I suppose that the problem is due to missing projection to
% non-auxiliary atoms before the minimality check
% (a similar problem occurred when I wrote the genuine solver).



% The external atom behaves like negation-as-failure,
% hence we have a kind of double negation in the body.
dom(a).

p(X) :- dom(X), not &testSetMinus[dom,p](X).
