 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 *
 * dlvhex evaluates Answer Set Programs with external atoms. One important
 * design principle was to provide a mechanism to easily add further external
 * atoms without having to recompile the main application. A \em plugin is a
 * shared library that provides functions to realise custom external atoms.
 * Furthermore, a plugin can supply rewriting facilities, which may alter the
 * input logic program prior to evaluation.
 *
 * This Section gives an overview of dlvhex plugins and external atoms.
 *
 * \section extatom The External Atom Function
 *
 * Formally, an external atom is defined to evaluate to \e true or \e
 * false, depending on a number of parameters:
 * - An interpretation (a set of facts)
 * - A list of input constants
 * - A list of output constants
 * .
 * However, it is more intuitive and convenient to think of an external atom not
 * as being boolean, but rather functional: Depending on a given interpretation
 * and a list of input constants, it returns output tuples. For instance, the
 * external atom to import triples from RDF files has this form:
 *
 * \code
 *   &rdf[uri](X,Y,Z)
 * \endcode
 *
 * where \c uri stands for a string denoting the RDF-source and \c X, \c Y, and
 * \c Z are variables that represent an RDF-triple. The function associated with
 * this atom simply returns all RDF-triples from the specified source.
 * Obviously, in this case the interpretation is ignored.
 *
 * \subsection informationflow Information Flow
 *
 * The interface that is used by dlvhex to access a plugin follows very closely
 * these semantics. For each atom, a retrieval function has to be implemented,
 * which receives a query-object and has to return an an answer-object. The
 * query-object carries the input interpretation as well as the ground input
 * parameters of the external atom call, while the answer object is a container
 * for the output tuples of the external atom's function.
 *
 * \subsection inputtypes Types of Input Parameters
 *
 * Theoretically, it is completely up to the atom function how to process the
 * interpretation together with the input constants, which are basically only
 * names. In practice however, only parts of the interpretation might be needed
 * (if at all). Considering this as well as for efficiency reasons, we created
 * two (in the implementation three, see below) categories of input parameters:
 * - the Constant parameter and
 * - the Predicate parameter.
 * A third category called Tuple exists, which is a meta category standing for
 * an arbitrary mount of Constant input parameters. This is useful, e.g.,
 * for &concat[s1,s2,...](Out).
 * 
 * A parameter of type "Constant" is not related to the interpretation at all,
 * like in the previous example of the RDF-atom. A parameter is of type
 * "Predicate" means that all facts in the interpretation with this predicate
 * are necessary for the atom. Let's assume, we have an external atom that
 * calculates the overall price of a number of books given by their ISBN number:
 *
 * \code
 *   &overallbookprice[isbn](X)
 * \endcode
 *
 * The single input parameter of this atom would be of type "Predicate", meaning
 * that not the constant itself is necessary for the atom's function, but the part
 * of the interpretation with this predicate.  So if we have, e.g.,
 * \f[
 * I=\{{\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}19{-}824183{-}6}), {\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}201{-}99954{-}4}), p(a), q(b),\ldots\}
 * \f]
 * the atom's function will be called with a "reduced" interpretation:
 * \f[
 * I=\{{\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}19{-}824183{-}6}), {\rm isbn}({\rm 0{-}201{-}99954{-}4})\}
 * \f]
 * Specifying the type of input parameters not only helps to single out the
 * relevant part of the interpretation, but also supports dlvhex in calculating
 * the dependencies within a HEX-program.
 *
 * \section writingplugin Writing a Plugin
 * We wanted to keep the interface between dlvhex and the plugins as lean as
 * possible.
 * Necessary tasks are:
 * - Registering the plugin with its interface and its version.
 *   This is easiest done using the define IMPLEMENT_PLUGINABIVERSIONFUNCTION
 *   and PLUGINIMPORTFUNCTION (see testsuite/TestPlugin.cpp)
 * - Implementing the PluginInterface (only the constructor is really mandatory).
 *
 * Usual tasks for implementing a plugin interface are at least one of the
 * following. We give the most usual implementation tasks first:
 * - external atoms (method createAtoms)
 * - a usage (--help) message (method printUsage)
 * - commandline option processing (method processOptions)
 * - input converter (method createConverter or createConverters)
 * - ProgramCtx modifications before evaluation (method setupProgramCtx)
 * - input parser modules (method createParserModules or createParser)
 * - program rewriter (method createRewriter)
 * - dependency graph optimizer (method createOptimizer)
 * 
 * For details about each of these tasks see the respective method
 * documentation, the test plugin in testsuite/TestPlugin.cpp,
 * the internal plugins
 * - QueryPlugin.{cpp,hpp},
 * - StrongNegationPlugin.{cpp,hpp}, and
 * - HigherOrderPlugin.{cpp,hpp},
 * as well as other basic plugins like the stringplugin and the scriptplugin.
 *
 * \section implementingeatoms Implementing External Atoms
 *
 * For implementing external computations there are two very different
 * possibilities: ComfortPluginAtom and PluginAtom.
 * - ComfortPluginAtom (in header ComfortPluginInterface.h)
 *   This interface requires no knowledge of the ID mechanism of dlvhex;
 *   every class processed in ComfortPluginAtom is defined in
 *   ComfortPluginInterface.h therefore this interface makes it easy to
 *   start developing with dlvhex. However this comes at the cost of
 *   performance.
 * - PluginAtom (in header PluginInterface.h)
 *   This interface is the native interface to implement external
 *   computations, in fact ComfortPluginAtom is implemented using
 *   PluginAtom. Using PluginAtom requires knowledge of how to deal with
 *   the Registry and ID classes.
 *
 * It is recommended to start prototyping using ComfortPluginAtom and then
 * later reimplement performance-critical external computations in the
 * PluginAtom interface. (The HEX programs do not change at all, just the
 * implementation of the external atom.)
 *
 * In TestPlugin.cpp, some plugin atoms are implemented both using
 * PluginAtom and ComfortPluginAtom in order to provide an example of the
 * differences.
 * 
 * \section compiling Building Plugins
 * 
 * We provide a toolkit for building plugins based on the GNU
 * Autotools (http://sourceware.org/autobook/)
 * environment. This means that you will need the respective tools installed on
 * your system - which is usually no problem, since they are provided as packages
 * by all major linux distributions.
 * You need packages for libtool, automake, and autoconf.
 * We also provide a dlvhex.m4 script for easier configuration of DLVHEX plugins,
 * see for its usage the dlvhex-stringplugin or the dlvhex-scriptplugin.

 * \section intro Overview
 *
 * The PluginInterface class can be seen as a wrapper for all user-defined
 * features of a plugin, which are:
 * - announce external atoms
 * - supply convert/rewrite/parse/optimize facilities
 * - supply model and final callbacks
 * - offer help messages and command line options
 *
 * You shall derive from PluginInterface in order to implement a plugin,
 * the constructor shall set name and version of the plugin,
 * preferrably defined in configure.ac using DLVHEX_DEFINE_VERSION.
 * (See dlvhex-stringplugin for an example.)
 *
 * \subsection importing Importing the Plugin
 *
 * To make the plugin available, we need to instantiate it. The simplest way to do
 * this is to define a global variable and the following code:
 * Assume your plugin class is RDFPlugin derived from PluginInterface and you have
 *
 * \code
 *   RDFPlugin theRDFPlugin;
 * \endcode
 *
 * Then you publish theRDFPlugin to dlvhex as follows:
 *
 * \code
 *   extern "C"
 *   void* PLUGINIMPORTFUNCTION()
 *   {
 *     return reinterpret_cast<void*>(&theRDFPlugin);
 *   }
 * \endcode

/**
 * \brief Interface class for external Atoms.
 *
 * \ingroup pluginframework
 *
 * An external atom is represented by a subclassed PluginAtom. The actual
 * evaluation function of the atom is realized in the PluginAtom::retrieve()
 * method. In the constructor, the user must specify monotonicity, the types of
 * input terms and the output arity of the atom.
 *
 * See also ComfortPluginInterface.
 *
 * \subsection extatom The External Atom
 *
 * First, we have to subclass PluginAtom to create our own \b RDFatom class:
 * 
 * \code
 *   class RDFatom: public PluginAtom
 *   {
 * \endcode
 * 
 * The constructor of \b RDFatom will be used to define some properties of the atom:
 *
 * \code
 *   public:
 *     RDFatom():
 *       PluginAtom("rdf", true)
 *     {
 *         addInputPredicate();
 *         setOutputArity(3);
 *     }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * We first specify predicate "&rdf" and monotonicity (it is monotonic).
 * Then we specify the number and types of input parameters. The RDF-atom
 * as we used it above, has a single input parameter, which is the name of
 * the predicate to hold the URIs. In this case, we just need a single call
 * to PluginAtom::addInputPredicate(). Another possibility would have been
 * to define the single input term as a constant, which represents the URI
 * directly (which means, that then there can only be one URI). In this
 * case, the input interpretation would be irrelevant, since we don't need
 * the extension of any predicate. To define a constant input parameter, we
 * use PluginAtom::addInputConstant().
 *
 * If we wanted to have, say, two input parameters which will represent
 * predicate names and a third one which will be a constant, we would put
 * this sequence of calls in the constructor:
 *
 * \code
 *   addInputPredicate();
 *   addInputPredicate();
 *   addInputConstant();
 * \endcode
 * 
 * The call \c setOutputArity(3) ensures that occurences of this atom with
 * other than three output terms will cause an error at parsing time.
 * 
 * The only member function of the atom class that needs to be defined is
 * retrieve:
 *
 * \code
 *   virtual void
 *   retrieve(const Query& query, Answer& answer)
 *   {
 * \endcode
 * 
 * retrieve() always takes a query object as input and returns the result tuples in an
 * answer object.
 * 
 * By definition the same query should return the same result, this is used by the 
 * method retrieveCached() which has the effect that retrieve() is never called twice
 * for the same query (if you do not disable the cache via --nocache).
 * 
 * In the implementation of retrieve, query.input contains the input tuple,
 * query.pattern contains the tuple of constants and variables an output
 * tuple should unify with, and query.interpretation is an interpretation
 * containing all relevant bits of predicate inputs.
 *
 * query.input and query.pattern store Term IDs, you resolve such IDs via
 * the table Registry::terms, except for integers which are directly
 * encoded in the ID::address member and are detected using ID::isInteger().
 *
 * Note that each constant has a unique ID in the Registry, therefore
 * obtaining const Term& from Registry::terms might not be necessary in all
 * cases, it might be sufficient to compare the ID without looking at the
 * actual (printable) content of the symbol.
 * 
 * \code
 *   if( query.input[0].isInteger() )
 *   {
 *      std::cerr << "got integer << query.input[0].address << std::endl;
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *      const Term& t = registry->terms.getByID(query.input[0]);
 *      std::cerr << "got term << t << std::endl;
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * You obtain all ground atoms in the interpretation by iterating over its
 * bits, or by testing individual bits.
 *
 * \code
 *   Interpretation::TrueBitIterator it, it_end;
 *   for(boost::tie(it, it_end) = query.interpretation.trueBits();
 *       it != it_end; ++it)
 *   {
 *     const OrdinaryAtom& gatom = registry->ogatoms.getByAddress(*it);
 *     std::cerr << "got atom in interpretation: " << gatom << std::endl;
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that each ground atom has a unique ID in the Registry, therefore
 * obtaining const OrdinaryAtom& from Registry::ogatoms might not be
 * necessary in all cases, it might be sufficient to compare the ID without
 * looking at the actual (printable) content of the symbol.
 *
 * For more information about accessing interpretation and IDs, please
 * refer to the documentation and header files of the classes ID, Registry,
 * Term, Atom, Interpretation, ...
 * 
 * At this point, the plugin author will implement the actual function of
 * the external atom, either within this class or by calling other
 * functions.
 *
 * Throwing exceptions will abort the model building process and display
 * the exception.
 * 
 * Answer tuples of data type Tuple which is std::vector<ID>, are added to
 * the answer object as follows:
 *
 * \code
 *   Tuple tuple;
 *   answer.get().push_back(tuple);
 * \endcode
 *
 * IDs put into tuple must either be integer IDs or Term IDs that have been
 * registered in table Registry::terms.
 *
 * \subsection registeratoms Registering the Atoms
 *
 * So far, we described the implementation of a specific external atom. In order
 * to integrate one or more atoms in the interface framework, the plugin author
 * needs to subclass PluginInterface and register all external atoms in
 * PluginInterface::createAtoms (see documentation of PluginInterface).
